**FRONTIER IS NOT YET LIVE**

Watch this: if issues for [Milestone Frontier](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones) are not 100% closed, we are not ready for release.

Issues are tracked [on github](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones/Frontier).

# Geth

`geth` is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go. 
It is the main deliverable of the [Frontier Release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Frontier)

## Capabilities

By installing and running `geth`, you can take part in the ethereum live testnet and
* mine real ether (at 10% of normal reward)
* transfer funds between addresses
* create contracts and send transactions
* explore block history
* and much much more

## Safety

Frontier is a live testnet. It is here to help us prepare for the main release.

* We fully expect instability and consensus flaws in the client, some of which may be exploitable
* As curators, we fully reserve the right to ignore blocks at our discretion
* As curators, from a final block that we solely determine, we will preserve all non-contract (i.e. code-less) account balances above the value of 1 ETH into the Homestead Genesis block

## Install 

Supported Platforms are Linux, Mac Os and Windows.

We support two types of installation: binary or scripted install for users. 
See [Install instructions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum) for binary and scripted installs.

Developers and community enthusiast are advised to read the [Developers' Guide](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Developers%27-Guide), which contains detailed instructions for manual build from source (on any platform) as well as detailed tips on testing, monitoring, contributing, debugging and submitting pull requests on github.

## Interfaces

* Javascript Console: `geth` can be launched with an interactive console, that provides a javascript runtime environment exposing a javascript API to interact with your node. [Javascript Console API](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console) includes the `web3` javascript √êapp API as well as an additional admin API. 
* JSON-RPC server: `geth` can be launched with a json-rpc server that exposes the [JSON-RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC)
* [Command line options](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options) documents command line parameters as well as subcommands.

## Basic Use Case Documentation

* [Managing accounts](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Managing-your-accounts)
* [Mining](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/mining)
* [Contracts and Transactions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contracts-and-Transactions)
