**FRONTIER IS NOT YET LIVE**

Watch this: if issues for [Milestone Frontier](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones) are not 100% closed, we are not ready for release.

Issues are tracked [on github](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestones/Frontier).

Frontier is the first in a series of releases. 

Frontier is a live testnet. It is here to help us prepare for the main release. 

* We fully expect instability and consensus flaws in the client, some of which may be exploitable
* As curators, we fully reserve the right to ignore blocks at our discretion
* As curators, from a final block that we solely determine, we will preserve all non-contract (i.e. code-less) account balances above the value of 1 ETH into the Homestead Genesis block

The focus of Frontier is the go implementation of an ethereum full node, with a command line interface codenamed `geth`. 

By [installing and running `geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Geth), you can take part in the ethereum live testnet, mine, transfer funds between addresses, create contracts and send transactions.
