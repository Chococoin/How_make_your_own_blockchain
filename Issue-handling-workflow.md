* Projects -- We use projects for a larger chunk of work with a specific outcome. A project can overarch multiple releases (its issues may be in multiple milestones), but it has an end.
* Workflow
    * We have a weekly or bi-weekly triage meeting. This is when we go through the new issues and do one of the following
        * Close it.
        * Assign it to the "Next tasks" milestone which doesn't have an end date.
        * Move it to the Backlog milestone.
        * Change its status to "Needs more information" or "Needs discussion".
